## **Requirements:**

1. The game should be between a user and the computer.
2. The game should ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer's choice should be selected randomly.
4. The game should compare the two choices and determine the winner. The rules for winning are as follows:
    - Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
    - Scissors beat Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
    - Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
5. The game should keep track of the score and display it at the end of each round. The score display should include the number of rounds the user has won, the number of rounds the computer has won, and the number of draws.
6. The game should continue in a loop until the user decides to quit.
7. The user should be able to quit the game at any point.

## **Extra Challenge:**

For students who finish early or want an extra challenge, consider adding one or more of the following features:

1. Add additional valid moves, such as Lizard and Spock (as in the extended version of the game popularized by "The Big Bang Theory" TV show). Update the winning rules to accommodate these new moves.
2. Add a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a library such as Tkinter. The GUI should display the choices for the user and the computer, show the current score, and provide buttons for the user to make their choice or quit the game.
3. Save the scores to a file and load them when the game starts. This way, scores can persist across multiple game sessions.
